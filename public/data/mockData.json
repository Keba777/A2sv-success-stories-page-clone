Before joining A2SV I dreamt about solving real-world problems and attaining something that I could focus on and make myself better from it. At that time, it is safe to say, I knew very little about data structure and algorithms. It was because of the A2SV program that I got comfortable with algorithms. From the program, students also learn about improving communication skills and being confident besides acquiring problem-solving skills."

Now, we know that it is possible to work anywhere as long as one works hard and utilizes opportunities."
